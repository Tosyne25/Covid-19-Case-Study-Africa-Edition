# COVID-19 Africa Case Study

## Brief Introduction:
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. It can be very contagious and spreads quickly. Over one million people have died from COVID-19 in the United States and 257,984 in Africa.

COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, the flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill.

The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on 14 February 2020, with the first confirmed case announced in Egypt. The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February 2020. Within three months, the virus had spread throughout the continent, as Lesotho, the last African sovereign state to have remained free of the virus, reported a case on 13 May 2020. By 26 May, it appeared that most African countries were experiencing community transmission, although testing capacity was limited. Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated.

### Problem Statement: 
The dataset consists of diverse data gathered from worldwide sources regarding Covid-19. This research seeks to pinpoint nations that effectively managed the pandemic and those that didn't. By doing so, we can pinpoint countries lacking essential resources to combat the virus.

#### Step 1: Question Statement
The following questions were asked:

* Total number of deaths in Africa caused by the Covid-19 pandemic
* How many African countries were affected?
* How many African countries got the booster shots?
* What African countries had the highest mortality rate?
* What African countries had the highest Covid-19 cases?
* What are the top 5 African countries that got the booster shots?
* What African countries had the highest number of new cases?
* Total deaths by continent
* African countries with the highest number of ICU patients
* Case Fatality rates in African countries
* Percent population infected
* Total deaths by country
* Likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in Africa (Death and Population Stats)
* Total number of individuals in Africa that have been vaccinated
* The number of people that have been vaccinated and the number of total vaccinations given
* Top 10 countries in Africa that had the highest population percentage that contacted Covid
* People Vaccinated versus Fatality Percentage

#### Step 2: Prepare
The dataset is located on Our World in Data. The dataset used for this analysis upon the initial uncleaned form, comes in a csv format with thousands of rows. There is no issue with bias or credibility of this data as it was gotten directly from the source. For the licensing, the dataset was made public directly by Our World in Data, which therefore means that it is open to the public to use for the analysis. For this dataset, I ensured to check the dataset for accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of the data throughout its lifecycle and by doing this, it shows that the dataset has consistent columns, and each column has the essential type of data required.

#### Step 3: Process/Analyze
In this step, the dataset was prepared for analysis and ensured that data had been compiled, filtered, sorted, and cleaned appropriately.

Tools used for the analysis:

* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
* Microsoft Excel
* Microsoft Power BI

Cleaning Activities:

* The dataset used was downloaded from Our World in Data platform.
* The different datasets were imported into the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
* The data was cleaned in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio by filtering for the particular location to be analyzed.
* A sense check was performed to ensure that the dataset had all the necessary information required for the analysis.
* The datasets were then imported to Power BI for visualization.


#### Step 4: Report

Conclusion:
* Country with the highest ICU Patients for South Africa (97.69%) was higher than Algeria (2.31%).
